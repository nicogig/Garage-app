# HomeCloud. Your house, anywhere in the world.
Welcome to the HomeCloud GitHub Project app!
HomeCloud's intentions are to connect your house to the cloud, making it "smarter" via Arduino and the dedicated app on your smartphone or via the websites of the Homecloud Platform Kits (HPKs).
# Requirements
In order to make a HPK module you need at least:
* An Arduino board (Reccomended boards are the Uno and Mega 2560, although you can use smaller boards to power small projects.)
* An Internet shield (I personally reccomend the Ethernet one, because it's dirt cheap.)
* Other equipment requested by the module you're going to build.
As of 17/01/2016, the HomeCloud app supports 2 actions:
* Open (a Garage, a door, basically anything that can be elctronically opened)
* Fetch & Display (from Athmo, our HPK module to track temperature, pressure, and much more.)
As of today, the source code for the HPK modules is not available yet, but it's going to be available at some point.
